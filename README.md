# Monorepo

This is a monorepo containing three projects. Each project has its own source code, package.json, README, and GitHub Actions workflow.

## Projects

- [Project 1](./project1/README.md)
- [Project 2](./project2/README.md)
- [Project 3](./project3/README.md)

Each project's README contains more information about the specific project.

## GitHub Actions

Each project has its own GitHub Actions workflow which is defined in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file in each project's directory.

## Dependencies

Each project has its own dependencies which are listed in the `package.json` file in each project's directory.
```

This README provides a brief overview of the monorepo and links to each individual project's README for more detailed information. It also explains where to find each project's GitHub Actions workflow and dependencies.
